This Python script is designed to perform a dictionary attack on a Wi-Fi network using the `pywifi` library. It scans available Wi-Fi networks, targets a specific SSID, and attempts to connect using passwords from a given file. Ideal for educational purposes and security testing.

## Features
- Scans available Wi-Fi networks.
- Targets a specific SSID.
- Loads a dictionary of passwords from a file.
- Attempts to connect to the target Wi-Fi network.
- Displays successful connections or failed attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pywifi` library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SagarBiswas-MultiHAT/wifi-dictionary-attack.git
   cd wifi-dictionary-attack
   ```

2. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install pywifi
   ```

## Usage
1. Create a file named `passwords.txt` in the same directory as the script. Add potential passwords, one per line.
2. Update the `target_ssid` variable in the script with the SSID of your target Wi-Fi network.
       target_ssid = "Sagar_Biswas_5G"
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python WiFi-Dictionary-Attack_v1.2.py
   ```
OR, 
   ```bash
   python WiFi-Dictionary-Attack_v1.2.py --ssid Sagar_Biswas_2.4G
